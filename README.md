# *The Digital Trails Handbook*

Hi there, you've found the home of *The Digital Trails Handbook*.

As part of our [Trails Stewardship Initiative](https://openstreetmap.us/trails), OpenStreetMap US is working to compile a comprehensive guide to the world of digital trail data.

Just like with OpenStreetMap, you can contribute your edits to the handbook. We'd love your help in making the best trail data guide in the business. 

## FAQ

#### Why not use the OSM Wiki?

The [OSM Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page) is an excellent technical resource, but we've found it can be tricky for newcomers to parse. While much of the content is the same, *The Digital Trails Handbook* aims to be a curated, approachable starting point for those who just want quick answers to common questions. The handbook is still community-driven, but serves a different purpose than the Wiki.
