Yes. OpenStreetMap relies on the concept of "ground truth." Features like trails are mapped as they exist on the ground, regardless of ownership.

## How does OpenStreetMap respect private property rights?

OpenStreetMap has "access tags" to specify what activities are allowed by a landowner. Trails closed to public use should be marked as privateâ€”if they are not, this is considered a data error.

Beyond denoting private trails, access tags can describe complex situations. For example: a landowner may allow hiking, prohibit ATVs, permit cycling with advanced notice, and allow horseback riding on weekdays only.

Access tags should be verifable, typically in the form of real-world signage or posted regulations.

## How does private trail data get into OpenStreetMap?

OpenStreetMap is a crowdsourced database maintained by volunteer "mappers." Mappers use a variety of sources to compile trail data, including publicly-available aerial imagery, ground-level photos, and government datasets.

It's not always clear from source data if a trail is public or private access. Some mappers conduct field surveys to gain additional info. If a trail is signed as private, the mapper will mark it as private on OSM.

## How do apps use private trail data from OpenStreetMap?

OpenStreetMap is a database, not a single map. Many recreation-focused maps and apps are built atop OSM, and they each make their own decisions about how to handle private trails.

OSM-based maps typically mark private trails as no-access, or hide them entirely. Apps will not route users down private trails when giving directions.

## What if OpenStreetMap says I can use a trail but a sign says I can't?

Obey posted signage. OpenStreetMap data may be incomplete or outdated, and is no excuse to trespass. The individiual trail user is responsibile for complying with property law.
